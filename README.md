* cd into frontend folder, open terminal and run npn start
* open another terminal window, cd into backend folder, and run npn start

## BDD
On clicking join us from homepage, the student gets a form, fills and submits, all fields are mandatory.
The details are stored on mongoDB and our students page is automatically updated with the new student details for immediate viewing. 
A person can view, delete, and update a student details.

#### NB:
In this release, we simply aimed to showcase understanding of the MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS) stack of technologies. We have endeavoured to implement all CRUD operations both frontend and backend. But we have no authentication at this stage and anyone can add, view, update, and delete students without any consequences. 

   
## Technologies Used
1. The frontend is built purely using reactJS
2. Backend runs on: 
  * Express
  * Node.js
  * Mongodb
3. Bootstrap used for styling components
4. VS Code Editor
